### Rakarrack Haiku is a port-in-progress of the great [rakarrack project](https://rakarrack.sourceforge.net/)

### Current Status:
- Pretty much everthing works like effects and even midi with the exception of a few things here there.
-  Midi velocity - not really needed but may look into it eventually. Low priority.
-  Background images.  Not really needed but had to remove them because the files caused a crash in 32bit builds likey due to pixel 4 byte misalignment. May add custom bg images another day. Low priority.
-  ACI - Not really sure even how to use this correctly.  Perhaps requires AUX input for secondary source.  Low priority.
- Midi mapping and other original midi settings - Not really sure how to do this either. Low priority.

Requires: Haiku 64bit or 32bit
